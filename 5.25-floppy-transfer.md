**Overview:** Move old geneaology data to something modern for backup, review and usage. 

# Phases
- Getting the data - how to get from 5.25 to modern/backedup location
- Exploring the content - how to see what data and what formats we have
- Building something - how to do something interesting with the family tree data (model, visualization, etc.)

## Getting the data 
- Will use the [greaseweazle](https://github.com/keirf/Greaseweazle) project hardware and software notes in the project wiki
### Hardware
   - [x] working 5.25 drive (Thank, Ralph!)
   - [x] test disk- Would like to figure out the commands and steps on a program disk or something before running the actual geneaology disks through the process
   - [x] USB cable
   - [x] Power supply with molex
   - [ ] greaseweazle controller
   - [ ] twisted ribbon cable
- set the terminating resistor on the drive somehow? jumper is set to d1 so will try that and in the last ribbon spot.
- I have a motherboard with an onboard power and reset switch already hooked up to a powersupply with molex, so will be using this to power the 5.25. alternatively if you want to skip the mobo and jump start the powersupply w/ a bit of wire or paper clip you can do that too ([more details on that here](https://www.overclockersclub.com/guides/atx_psu_startup/))   
```
[powersupply / molex lead] --> [5.25 drive] <-- ribbon cable --> [greaseweazle controller] <-- usb cable --> [laptop]
```    
### Software
-  will start with these two pieces of software: [greaseweazle](https://github.com/keirf/greaseweazle) and [fluxvis](https://github.com/adafruit/fluxvis)

## Exploring the content
- recieved much larger collection than initially expected; 50+ misc 5.25 disks
- all seem dos focused (DOS apps or misc data disks- assuming formated/used for DOS)


## Building something
- this all started because had a hunch the printed binders were too well organized to not have some kind of electronic data structure
- there was a lot of key value stype things, but no over all family tree visual
- I wanted to make a tree you can navigate through, click on to pop out details, stuff like that.
