**Overview:** Move old geneaology data to something modern for backup, review and usage. 

# Phases
- Getting the data - how to get from 5.25 to modern/backedup location
    - Will use the [greaseweazle](https://github.com/keirf/Greaseweazle) project
    - Hardware
        - [x] working 5.25 drive (Thank, Ralph!)
        - [ ] test disk? Would like to try it out before running the actual geneaology disks through
        - [x] USB cable
        - [x] Power supply with molex
        - [ ] greaseweazle controller
        - [ ] twisted ribbon cable
    - set the terminating resistor on the drive somehow?
- Exploring the files - not sure what formats, extent, etc.
- Building something - family tree model/visualization
