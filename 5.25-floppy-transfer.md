**Overview:** Move old geneaology data to something modern for backup, review and usage. 

# Phases
- Getting the data - how to get from 5.25 to modern/backedup location
- Exploring the content - how to see what data and what formats we have
- Building something - how to do something interesting with the family tree data (model, visualization, etc.)

## Getting the data 
- Will use the [greaseweazle](https://github.com/keirf/Greaseweazle) project hardware and software notes in the project wiki
- Hardware
   - [x] working 5.25 drive (Thank, Ralph!)
   - [x] test disk- Would like to figure out the commands and steps on a program disk or something before running the actual geneaology disks through the process
   - [x] USB cable
   - [x] Power supply with molex
   - [ ] greaseweazle controller
   - [ ] twisted ribbon cable
- set the terminating resistor on the drive somehow? jumper is set to d1 so will try that and in the last ribbon spot.


## Exploring the content
- recieved much larger collection than initially expected; 50+ misc 5.25 disks
- all seem dos focused (DOS apps or misc data disks- assuming formated/used for DOS)


## Building something
- this all started because had a hunch the printed binders were too well organized to not have some kind of electronic data structure
- there was a lot of key value stype things, but no over all family tree visual
- I wanted to make a tree you can navigate through, click on to pop out details, stuff like that.
