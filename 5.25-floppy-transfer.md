**Overview:** Move old geneaology data to something modern for backup, review and usage. 

# Phases
- Getting the data - how to get from 5.25 to modern/backedup location
- Exploring the content - how to see what data and what formats we have
- Building something - how to do something interesting with the family tree data (model, visualization, etc.)

## Getting the data 
- Will use the [greaseweazle](https://github.com/keirf/Greaseweazle) project hardware and software notes in the project wiki
### Hardware
   - [x] working 5.25 drive (Thank, Ralph!)
   - [x] test disks - figure out the commands and steps on a program disk or something replaceable before running the actual valuable disks through the process
   - [x] USB cable
   - [x] Power supply with molex
   - [x] greaseweazle controller
   - [x] twisted ribbon cable
- jump start the powersupply w/ a bit of wire or paper clip ([more details on that here](https://www.overclockersclub.com/guides/atx_psu_startup/))   
### Hook it up
```
[powersupply / molex lead] --> [5.25 drive] <-- ribbon cable --> [greaseweazle controller] <-- usb cable --> [laptop]
```    
- I had some trouble with basic stuff like what is up, what is down, which way does disk go in, etc....
   - the ribbon cable has a strip that is colored to help with orientation, line this polarity line up with the triangle on the greaseweazle connector. (The greaseweazle female 34 pin isn't keyed, so pay attention to this)
  - On the connection to the actual drive, it is keyed so there is only one way to attach it. Connect the last position on the cable to the drive (the 'A:' position in a lot of pictures)
  - I left my drive jumper settings to D1 and didn't do any 'terminating resistor' stuff that they mention in the greaseweasle wiki
  - Keep the drive flat, for the me, the jumpers and spinning drum would be down against the table
  - Disks go in with the 'window' first, typically this means the label will be closest to you and facing up

### Software
-  will start with these three pieces of software: [greaseweazle](https://github.com/keirf/greaseweazle) and [fluxvis](https://github.com/adafruit/fluxvis)

## Exploring the content
- recieved much larger collection than initially expected; 50+ misc 5.25 disks
- all seem dos focused (DOS apps or misc data disks- assuming formated/used for DOS)


## Building something
- this all started because had a hunch the printed binders were too well organized to not have some kind of electronic data structure
- there was a lot of key value stype things, but no over all family tree visual
- I wanted to make a tree you can navigate through, click on to pop out details, stuff like that.
