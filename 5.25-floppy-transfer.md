**Overview:** Move old geneaology data to something modern for backup, review and usage. 

# Phases
- Getting the data - how to get from 5.25 to modern/backedup location
    - Will use the [greaseweaszle](https://github.com/keirf/Greaseweazle) project
    - Hardware
        - [x] working 5.25 drive (Thank, Ralph!)
        - [ ] test disk? Would like to try it out before running the actual geneaology disks through
        - [ ] power cable - molex to floppy drive maybe?
        - [ ] data cable - twisted ribbon
        - [ ] powersupply
- Exploring the files - not sure what formats, extent, etc.
- Building something - family tree model/visualization
